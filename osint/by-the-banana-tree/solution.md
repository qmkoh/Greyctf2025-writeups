Being new to competitions as such, I started with the naive method. I tried to reverse google image search the given image, unfortunately, with limited success. But it did give me the idea the knowledge that this location would be in a foreign country given that nothing that popped up was easily legible by my poor untrained eyes. Thus, heading off to a great start I decided to look back upon the given resource above.

What did I find? Well I started off looking left to right, top to bottom. The scenery starting off with the hills in the back are reminiscent of the beauty of our own local landmarks such as little guilin at bukit batok. Wonderful place to go for a short walk if you dear reader find the time and are in the area. Full with lustruous greenery there are few human made landmarks in the picture, of the few that are available a church, traffic light, light pole, and road post can be seen. 

Now I don't find myself to be a very devoted catholic, but even I know that in whichever religious country it could be, there would be a multitude of churches built for their little cult. So narrowing it based on the building or scenery seemed like impossible at the moment.
