Being new to competitions as such, I started with the naive method. I tried to reverse google image search the given image, unfortunately, with limited success. But it did give me the idea the knowledge that this location would be in a foreign country given that nothing that popped up was easily legible by my poor untrained eyes. Thus, heading off to a great start I decided to look back upon the given resource above.

What did I find? Well I started off looking left to right, top to bottom. The scenery starting off with the hills in the back are reminiscent of the beauty of our own local landmarks such as little guilin at bukit batok. Wonderful place to go for a short walk if you dear reader find the time and are in the area. Full with lustruous greenery there are few human made landmarks in the picture, of the few that are available a church, traffic light, light pole, and road post can be seen. 

Now I don't find myself to be a very devoted catholic, but even I know that in whichever religious country it could be, there would be a multitude of churches built for their little cult. So narrowing it based on the building or scenery seemed like impossible at the moment. That left the remaining items once again. 

Lets look back at the picture. My next flash of inspiration came from the signs, surely certain color schemes are reserved or employed by certain countries. Yes, but no. Wikipedia will have you know of a multitude of countries that use the color blue for their signs, but it made me realize that if I were to spend looking at the signs of every country with blue on white signs, I might end up in a nursing home first.

Logically, this means that we should narrow down to a country first. But with only a road, I was quite literally stumped. So I just decided to try my luck with the stump containing the only legible words in the picture. QL32 and DT317G. Surprisingly, perhaps not to the experienced, this actually resulted in a set of roads in Vietnam! The hunt was on. I progressed, felt like a king and decided that even if I had to look at all the churches near these roads I would. And that's exactly what I did.
