# Greyctf 2025 challenges
This competition was definitely not for beginners, and is instead around intermediate level instead. There are definitely beginner-level challenges available but the common pitfall we fell into was spending too much time on the intermediate ones and neglecting the more doable ones. During the competition period, me and my partner managed to solve 5 challenges (excluding the sanity check) and emerged top 30% globally. We continued to work on some challenges that we were close to solving but did not manage to do it in time and managed to capture more flags since.
